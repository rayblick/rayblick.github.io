                                    The VE toolset can optimize transect length in an ecological monitoring program.
                                    The primary goal is to reduce transect length (and overall cost)
                                    without losing the power to detect a difference between surveys
                                    (e.g. seasonal surveys).<br><br>

                                            change and reduce cost by optimising time spent collecting data.</i></h4><br><br>

                                    These tools assume that the data were collected from transects
                                    (which are variable in length), and each transect contains sequential
                                    data collection points (e.g. A 50 meter transect with 1m2 plots
                                    spaced 4 meters apart) to assess grouped data at an individual location
                                    (e.g. functional groups, lifeforms, guilds or a custom list
                                    of groupings used to cluster species).<br><br>

                                    <h4> Background </h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Simulating data is a common method in ecology to evaluate patterns of interacting species.
                                        A classic example was the approach by Connor and Simberloff (1979), who re-evaluated Jared Diamond's (1975)
                                        assembly rules for bird species on the Bismarck Archipelago. By employing a simple null model, Connor and
                                        Simberloff (1979) compared the original co-occurrence pattern of birds on islands, with a virtual dataset
                                        that would arise if bird species randomly occupied islands. There are many examples of similar
                                        tests in ecology; the code I have written is geared towards the virtual ecologist approach of simulating
                                        data collection for the purpose of optimising vegetation surveys.<br><br>

                                        The virtual ecologist is an "approach where simulated data and observer models are used to mimic real species
                                        and how they are virtually observed." (Zurell et al. 2009). Under this scenario, a researcher can model the
                                        entire data collection process and evaluate the effects of different sampling designs and sampling effort
                                        in different environments. The code I present
                                        <a href=https://github.com/rayblick/Virtual-Ecologist/blob/master/virtualecologist/virtualecologist.py style="color: blue!important;">here</a>
                                        employs the virtual ecologist approach to generate a second observer (sometimes refered to as a pseudo-observer)
                                        for an entire flora monitoring programme that would allow me to calculate the minimum detectable difference (MDD)
                                        that we expect to see as we reduced transect length. The overall aim is to reduce transect length to a minimum
                                        size that will allow us to detect an <i>a priori</i> trigger value that we determined necessary in the monitoring
                                        programme, and ulitmately optimise our time spent in the field.<br><br>
